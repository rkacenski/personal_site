                            After reading an article from the CEO of Post Light,
                            Paul Ford. I rediscovered why I started programming.
                            Simply, it was to connect people. At the age of 12 I
                            knew how to take off and land a 737, a Learjet, and
                            a few other airplanes. This of course was all in
                            part of Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The game
                            brought me into the immersive world where I could
                            learn how to fly. The multiplayer servers eventually
                            connected to me a flying club, AshevilleATC. I knew
                            these guys and gals for over 5 years. It was because
                            of this community I taught myself how to code. The
                            necessity to have a website and forum to communicate
                            between members was an important asset for the
                            online community. Not much different that any other
                            online community. I took on the responsibility to
                            learn and develop out the website for the needs of
                            the community. Allowing us to connect with members,
                            and have online flying events. But the ability to
                            connect people, to a new world, new people, ideas
                            and experiences; is an unbelievable feat. Therefore
                            the power to gather people online but also in person
                            should not be taken lightly. As people building
                            digital products to enable these interactions we
                            should not be dulled by the day to day actives.
                            However, impressed by the capabilities and possible
                            we have in front of us to day. Bringing able to
                            reach more users, communicate faster, and
                            efficiently; are powers that did not exists years
                            ago.
